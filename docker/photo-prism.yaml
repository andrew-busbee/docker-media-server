    ## Storage Folders: "~" is a shortcut for your home directory, "." for the current directory
    volumes:
      # "/host/folder:/photoprism/folder"                # example
      - "$ORINGINALDIR:/photoprism/originals"               # original media files (photos and videos)

      - "$DOCKERDIR/photoprism/data:/photoprism/storage"                  # *writable* storage folder for cache, database, and sidecar files (never remove)

  ## Database Server (recommended)
  ## see https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/faq/#should-i-use-sqlite-mariadb-or-mysql
  mariadb:
    ## If MariaDB gets stuck in a restart loop, this points to a memory or filesystem issue:

    ## Never store database files on an unreliable device such as a USB flash drive, an SD card, or a shared network folder:
